# Getting Started
IRLAmongUs is developed in JavaScript, React, and firebase (BaaS). As such, this project requires `node.js` to be installed on the system running it. If node.js is not already installed, download the latest (stable) version [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

Node comes with two package managers, `npm` and `yarn`. This project uses `yarn`. Note: it is recommended not to mix-and-match managers, i.e., do not use `npm`.

Once node has been installed, `cd` into the root project directory and install project dependencies:

```
$ cd <root-project-directory>
$ yarn install
```

This command installs all "dependencies" and "devDependencies" in *package.json* to an (untracked) directory, **node_packages** in the root project directory.

Once dependencies have been added, you are ready to develop, test, and build! Below are available `yarn` scripts to get you off the ground.

Go ahead, give `yarn start` a shot and see how it goes!

## Available `yarn` Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
